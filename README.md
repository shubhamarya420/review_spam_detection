# review_spam_detection
Here we are detecting fake reviews in 4 steps of checking. First, if a user gives multiple reviews on the same product, it will count as spam. Second, if a user reviews more than one product and all products' content is similar, it will count as spam, next whether a username contains a brand name or uses a brand name in his review, or using a product name multiple times.
